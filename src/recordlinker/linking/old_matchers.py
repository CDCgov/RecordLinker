    match evaluation rule to determine the final verdict on whether two
    records are indeed a match.

    A feature function is of the form "feature_match_X" for some condition
    X; it must accept two records (lists of data), an index i in which the
    feature to compare is stored, and the parameter **kwargs. It must return
    a boolean indicating whether the features "match" for whatever definition
    of match the function uses (i.e. this allows modular logic to apply to
    different features in the compared records). Note that not all features
    in a record need a comparison function defined.

    A match evaluation rule is a function of the form "eval_X" for some
    condition X. It accepts as input a list of booleans, one for each feature
    that was compared with feature funcs, and determines whether the
    comparisons constitute a match according to X.
